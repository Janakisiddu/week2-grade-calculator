# Week 2 – Student Grade Calculator

## Project Description
This project is a Python-based Student Grade Calculator developed as part of Week 2 learning.  
The program accepts marks for multiple students, calculates their average scores, assigns grades using conditional logic, and displays individual results along with overall class statistics.

## Objectives
- Practice control flow using if-elif-else
- Use loops to process multiple students
- Apply lists and dictionaries for data storage
- Implement input validation and error handling
- Display formatted output and statistics

## Features
- Accepts multiple student records
- Validates marks between 0 and 100
- Calculates average marks
- Assigns grades with remarks
- Displays results in table format
- Shows class statistics (average, highest, lowest)
